<b>PascalSECURE</b> is a securitysystem for the most popular standard controls of Lazarus

Every securecontrol (Button, Edit, TabSheets,...) can activated/deactivated by free defined keys. You have to write only the logic depended on your need. Database, Textfiles, API,... all is possible.

It is a standalone part of PascalSCADA 1.0 - A multiplatform SCADA framework for Lazarus. This code is a entire rewrite of PascalSCADA hosted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/pascalscada. The main goal of this initiative is:

  1) Make security easy for normal applications
  2) Extend the security system to all standard controls of Lazarus
  3) Improve the translation, using .PO files instead of language defines
  4) Improve the project modularization
